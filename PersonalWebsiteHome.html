                Hi, my name is Matan. I am a passionate engineer that enjoys creating, learning, and optimizing. My passion for programming started at the National High School Game Academy at Carnegie Mellon University in 2018. From the projects there I fell in love with the process of building and improving, seeing my creations improve incrementally inspired me to keep working towards my goals. This love for improving then spread to all aspects of my life, motivating me to work every day to improve one aspect of my life each and every day.
                <br><br>P.S. I also love climbing

                        Splendor is a card game where players compete to build Renaissance Europe's most lucrative jewelry business by acquiring gems, purchasing mines, and gaining the favor of nobles. This implementation of Splendor was implemented with a Java backend and a JavaFX frontend, we used technologies such as REST, Docker, Maven, and Git in developing it as part of our year-long project for COMP 361 at McGill University.

                        One of my favorite courses in university has been Fundamentals of Computer Graphics. Learning about all the processes that take place to bring a coded image onto a screen has transformed the way I think about TV, movies, and games. This ray tracer project is an implementation of ray tracing technology that has become so prevalent in graphics today. Feel free to explore some sample images and the code behind them

In a team of three, Light at the End was our creation. A witty point and click adventure game where a player must make decisions, trade resources, and travel through a post apocalyptic New York City Subway system. We used Unity game engine to build it, check it out

Learning how to create habits that occur automatically has allowed me to do many important daily tasks to better my health, increase my work output, and advance my learning all while freeing cognitive effort that I can direct towards more demanding tasks.
