                Hi, my name is Matan. I am a passionate engineer that enjoys creating, learning, and optimizing. My passion for programming started at the National High School Game Academy at Carnegie Mellon University in 2018. From the projects there I fell in love with the process of building and improving, seeing my creations improve incrementally inspired me to keep working towards my goals. This love for improving then spread to all aspects of my life, motivating me to work every day to improve one aspect of my life each and every day.

This book provides a framework of human psychology as if it were just that, an operating system, and how we can reprogram our mind to think, work, and feel better than ever before.</div>
